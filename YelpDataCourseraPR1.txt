Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT primary-key-name)
FROM table

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 2052
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = id;10000 , business_id;8090 , user_id;9581
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = id;10000  , business_id;6493
viii. Tip = user_id;537 , business_id;3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

FROM business
WHERE city=='Avon'
GROUP BY stars 


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns ñ star rating and count):

+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   1.5 |    10 |
|   2.5 |     6 |
|   3.5 |    88 |
|   4.0 |    21 |

|   5.0 |     3 |
+-------+-------+


ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT stars,
SUM(review_count) AS count
FROM business
WHERE city=='Beachwood'
GROUP BY stars 


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns ñ star rating and count):

+-------+-------+
| stars | count |
+-------+-------+
|   2.0 |     8 |
|   2.5 |     3 |
|   3.0 |    11 |
|   3.5 |     6 |
|   4.0 |    69 |
|   4.5 |    17 |
|   5.0 |    23 |
+-------+-------+
		


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT 
	name,
	review_count
	FROM user 
	ORDER BY review_count DESC
	LIMIT 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	SELECT 
	name,
	review_count,
	fans,
	yelping_since 
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC 

	To some extent review count and fans are correlated, but quantifying this 
	
	would require a built in square root function to calculate the Pearson 		  			
	Coefficient. The amount of time that has been spent yelping is also a factor.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	
	There are more reviews with the work "love" than "hate".

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE "%hate%"

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE "%love%"

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT
	id, 
	name,
	fans
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC
	LIMIT 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	+------------------------+-----------+------+
	| id                     | name      | fans |
	+------------------------+-----------+------+

	+------------------------+-----------+------+

	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as ìusefulî or ìfunnyî?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SELECT
	id,
	name,
	fans,
	useful,
	funny,
	review_count,
	yelping_since
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC
	LIMIT 10
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+-----------+------+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

	I used R to calculate the Pearson correlation values of the number of fans with useful and funny 	respectively.  The coefficients calculated were 0.141 and 0.136, which would indicate a very low 	relationship.  
	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

   Restaurants with shorter hours seem to have more stars.  However this isn't a reliable 

   inference because the query only returned four businesses, which is not a large sample 

   size. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

   The restaurant with longer business hours tend to have more reviews, however
   
   Edulis seems to be an outlier as it has the shortest hours but the most reviews.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

    No because only four businesses were returned and they all have distinct postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
B.name,
B.review_count,
H.hours,
postal_code,
CASE
	WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
	WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
	WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
	WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
	WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
	WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
	WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
END AS ord,
CASE
	  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
		WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
END AS star_rating
FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
ON B.id = H.business_id
INNER JOIN category C
ON C.business_id = B.id
WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto'
AND
C.category LIKE 'Restaurants')
AND
(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
OR
B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
GROUP BY stars,ord
ORDER BY ord,star_rating ASC



		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

The businesses that are open far outnumber than the businesses that have closed.  
         
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
The businesses that are open have much more reviews on average and in total than the businesses that have closed.         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
AVG(review_count),
SUM(review_count),
AVG(stars),
is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Predict how many stars a business will get on yelp.  This will help businesses decided which factors (hours, location, category, etc) will affect how they are received by reviewers.  This analysis will not include text data from reviews.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

This analysis should help businesses understand how different factors will get them better ratings.  We will need all the data about their location; this includes the state, postal code, neighborhood, attitude and longitude.  We will also need the descriptions of the business, the hours they are open, their attributes, review counts, and of course stars.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
